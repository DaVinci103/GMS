  <p>
    Gap Matrix System (GMS) is an ordinal notation system created by me (DV103). My main inspiration for this project is <a href="https://googology.fandom.com/wiki/Bashicu_matrix_system">Bashicu Matrix System</a> (BMS), in particular, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04606">Yto's proof of termination of BMS</a>. BMS is an expansion-based ordinal notation. Terms in BMS are x &times; y matrices of natural numbers for naturals x and y. I'll write these matrices as BMS(a<sub>11</sub>,...,a<sub>1y</sub>)...(a<sub>x1</sub>,...,a<sub>xy</sub>). Yto shows in the proof a connection between BMS and <a href="https://googology.fandom.com/wiki/Stable_ordinal">stable ordinals</a>. Stability is a concept in set theory, defined as follows:
  </p>

  <p class="q">
    <b>[Definition 1]</b> For positive natural n and ordinals &alpha; and &beta;, &alpha; is said to be &Sigma;<sub>n</sub>-&beta;-stable iff L<sub>&alpha;</sub> &prec;<sub>&Sigma;<sub>n</sub></sub> L<sub>&beta;</sub>.
  </p>

  <p>
    I.e. for all &Sigma;<sub>n</sub>-sentences &varphi; with parameters from L<sub>&alpha;</sub>, L<sub>&alpha;</sub> &models; &varphi; iff L<sub>&beta;</sub> &models; &varphi;. Let &alpha; &prec;<sub>n</sub> &beta; denote that &alpha; is &Sigma;<sub>n</sub>-&beta;-stable. Yto showed in her proof in lemma 2.6 that for all positive naturals n, all ordinals &alpha; and &beta; so that &alpha; is &Sigma;<sub>n</sub>-&beta;-stable and all finite sets X &sub; &beta;, there is some finite set Y &sub; &alpha; and a mapping f: X &rightarrow; Y so that:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>For all x &isinv; X &cap; &alpha;, x = f(x);</li>
    <li>For all x,y &isinv; X, x &lt; y iff f(x) &lt; f(y);</li>
    <li>For all x,y &isinv; X and all positive naturals k, x &prec;<sub>k</sub> y iff f(x) &prec;<sub>k</sub> f(y);</li>
    <li>For all x,y &isinv; X and all positive naturals m &lt; n, x &prec;<sub>m</sub> &beta; iff f(x) &prec;<sub>m</sub> &alpha;.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    (The exact lemma she proved is a little different but equivalent.) You might notice that this is similar to patterns of resemblance, but you probably don't because you don't know what that is. One can define a notion similar to that of patterns of resemblance that mimics stability:
  </p>

  <p class="q">
    <b>[Definition 2]</b> For positive natural n and ordinals &alpha; and &beta;, &alpha; &lt;<sub>n</sub> &beta; iff (&alpha;, &lt;, &lt;<sub>k</sub>, &lt;<sub>m</sub> &alpha;)<sub>0&lt;k&lt;&omega;, 0&lt;m&lt;n</sub> &prec;<sub>&Sigma;<sub>1</sub></sub> (&beta;, &lt;, &lt;<sub>k</sub>, &lt;<sub>m</sub> &beta;)<sub>0&lt;k&lt;&omega;, 0&lt;m&lt;n</sub>.
  </p>

  <p>
    I.e. for all finite sets X &sub; &beta;, there is a finite set Y &sub; &alpha; so that (Y, &lt;, &lt;<sub>k</sub>, &lt;<sub>m</sub> &alpha;)<sub>0&lt;k&lt;&omega;, 0&lt;m&lt;n</sub> is topologically equivalent to (X, &lt;, &lt;<sub>k</sub>, &lt;<sub>m</sub> &beta;)<sub>0&lt;k&lt;&omega;, 0&lt;m&lt;n</sub>: there exists a homeomorphism f: X &rightarrow; Y between them. I tried to make transfinite extension of this, which eventually brought me to this ternary relation:
  </p>
  
  <p class="q">
    <b>[Definition 3]</b> For ordinals &alpha;, &beta; and &gamma; so that &alpha; &le; &beta; &le; &gamma;, R(&alpha;,&beta;,&gamma;) iff (&beta;, &alpha;, &lt;, R) &PrecedesSlantEqual;<sub>&Sigma;<sub>1</sub>(&alpha;)</sub> (&gamma;, &beta;, &lt;, R).
  </p>

  <p>
    You might notice that the relation R(&alpha;,&beta;,&beta;+n) for naturals n is similar to &alpha; &lt;<sub>n+1</sub> &beta;. Terms in my ordinal notation are matrices of numbers with 3 rows so that each column (z,y,x) denotes an ordinal f(z) and a relation R(f(x),f(y),f(z)), and the expansion algorithm is based on reflection principles of R.

  <p>
    For matrices X and Y, X + Y denotes the concatenation of X and Y. A term in GMS is an l &times; 3 matrix M of natural numbers for some natural l with the following properties:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>The top row of M is monotonically increasing from 0 (0, 1, 2, ...);</li>
    <li>Each column (z,y,x) of M is non-strictly decreasing (x &le; y &le; z).</li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    For natural x &lt; l, the x<sup>th</sup> column of M refers to the unique column with x in the top row. For naturals x,y &lt; l, the part of M from x to y refers to the part of M starting at, including, the x<sup>th</sup> column up to, excluding, the y<sup>th</sup> column. For x = y, this refers to the empty matrix. For natural n, the expansion of M with respect to n, denoted M[n], is defined as follows:
  </p>

  <p>
    Let (c,b,a) be the last column of M. Let A be the part of M from 0 to a, let B be the part of M from a to b and let C be the part of M from b to c. Note that A + B + C is M without its last column. Let D = B if b = c, otherwise, let D = B' + C where B' consists of only the right-most column of B. Let k be the length of D. For each 0 &le; i &lt; n, let D<sub>i</sub> be a k &times; 3 matrix. D<sub>i</sub> is D with every instance of a number x &GreaterEqual; b increased by ki + k and every instance of a number x &isinv; [a,b) replaced with x + ki + b - a. M[n] is then defined as A + B + C + D<sub>0</sub> + ... + D<sub>n-1</sub>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Let o be a mapping from GMS terms to ordinals. For GMS term M, if M is empty then o M := 0, if M is not empty then o M := sup{o M[n] | n &lt; &omega;}. I coin the ordinal o (0,0,0)(1,1,0)(2,1,0)(3,2,1) as Large. I expect Large to correspond with the PTO of KP<sub>0</sub> augmented by the axiom of powerset (not to be confused with KPP<sub>0</sub>, which has stronger sepparation and comprehension).
  </p>

  <p>
    GMS terms can be abbreviated. Abbreviations for GMS terms are made by removing duplicate elements from a column, replacing paretheses with spaces, removing the comma's and renaming multi-digit numbers to a single character if needed, e.g. (0,0,0)(1,1,0)(2,1,0)(3,2,1)(4,2,0)(5,5,4)(6,6,6)(7,7,6)(8,7,6)(9,7,6)(10,7,6)(11,11,6) &rightarrow; 0 10 210 321 420 54 6 76 876 976 A76 B6. GMS terms are ordered lexicographically using the abbreviations as described above, e.g. (0,0,0)(1,1,1) &lt; (0,0,0)(1,1,0) as 0 1 < 0 10 lexicographically. For a column (z,y,x) with x &ne; y of a GMS term M, call the parent of (z,y,x) the x<sup>th</sup> column for y = z and the y<sup>th</sup> column for y &ne; z. A GMS term M can alternatively be abbreviated by replacing each column (z,y,x) with 1 if x = y and the replacement of its parent plus one, and if y &ne; z, plus the number of ancestors of the x<sup>th</sup> column, where an ancestor is itself or a parent of another ancestor. For example, (0,0,0)(1,1,0)(2,1,0)(3,2,1)(4,2,0)(5,5,4)(6,6,6)(7,7,6)(8,7,6)(9,7,6)(10,7,6)(11,11,6) &rightarrow; 1,2,4,7,6,7,1,2,4,4,4,2.
